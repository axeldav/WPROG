          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hi, my name is Axel Davidsson and I am a big fan of soccer and playing the piano. 
            I have been playing soccer since I was a kid and have always loved the thrill of the game. 
            I have also been playing the piano for many years and enjoy the challenge of learning new pieces 
            and perfecting my technique. In my spare time, 
            I enjoy watching soccer games and practicing my piano skills.</p>

          <h2>Soccer</h2>
          <p>Soccer is my favorite sport and I have always been drawn to its fast-paced, exciting nature. I have played on various teams throughout my life and have always enjoyed the camaraderie and competition that comes with being part of a team. Some of my fondest memories are of playing soccer with my friends and teammates.</p>

          <h2>Piano</h2>
          <p>I have been playing the piano for many years and it has always been a passion of mine. I enjoy the challenge of learning new pieces and perfecting my technique, and I find the process of creating music to be incredibly fulfilling. Some of my favorite pieces to play are classical works by composers such as Beethoven and Mozart, but I also enjoy dabbling in other genres such as jazz and pop.</p>
