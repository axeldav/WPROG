        <h2>History of work</h2>
        <p>I have a long history of working in heavy labor jobs. 
          Throughout my career, I have taken on various roles such as a cleaner and an airport luggage handler. 
          I pride myself on my strong work ethic and dedication to getting the job done right. 
          In this webpage, I will share more about my experiences and what I have learned from 
          each of these jobs.</p>

        <h2>Cleaner</h2>
        <p>One of my first jobs was working as a cleaner. In this role, I was responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of various buildings and facilities. I learned how to properly use cleaning supplies and equipment, and I developed strong attention to detail as I worked to ensure that every surface was thoroughly cleaned. I also learned the importance of time management and organization, as I had to work efficiently to complete my tasks within the allotted time.</p>

         <h2>Airport Luggage Handler</h2>
      <p>I also spent some time working as an airport luggage handler. In this role, I was responsible for loading and unloading luggage onto planes and ensuring that it was properly handled and accounted for. I learned how to safely lift and move heavy objects, and I developed strong communication skills as I had to work closely with other members of the airport team to ensure that luggage was properly routed and delivered to the correct destinations. I also learned the importance of attention to detail, as any mistakes in handling luggage could have serious consequences.</p>
