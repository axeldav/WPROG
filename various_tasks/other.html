    <h1>Trees</h1>
    <p>Trees are plants that have a single trunk and branches <em>that extend outwards</em> from the trunk. They are typically found in forest ecosystems and are an important part of the Earth's ecosystem, providing habitat for wildlife and helping to regulate the climate and air quality.</p>
    <h2 id="types">Types of Trees</h2>
    <div class="columns">
      <p><mark>There are many different types of trees</mark>, including conifers, broadleaf trees, and palm trees. Conifers, such as pine trees and fir trees, have needle-like leaves and produce seeds in cones. Broadleaf trees, such as oak trees and maple trees, have flat leaves and produce seeds in fruits or capsules. Palm trees are a type of tree that have long, slender leaves and are often associated with tropical climates.</p>
      <p>Trees can also be classified by <blockquote>growth habit, such as deciduous trees that lose their leaves in the fall,</blockquote> or evergreen trees that keep their leaves year-round. Some trees are also known for their unique or unusual characteristics, such as the baobab tree with its large, swollen trunk, or the Dawn Redwood with its distinct, reddish bark.</p>
